            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>HEre followeth the Answer to <hi>William Penn the Quaker</hi> his Book written against <hi>Reeve</hi> and <hi>Muggleton,</hi> who hath declared as a great secret to the world, that <hi>God is not an Infinite Spirit in every place at all times,</hi> he calls old Heresie. In <hi>Pag.</hi> the 6. <hi>Penn</hi> saith, it is contrary to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which say, <hi>He measures out the Heavens with his span,</hi> nor, <hi>can the heaven of heavens contain him. Penn</hi> saith, that this is against Scripture; we prove his first proof of Scripture is <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.26, 27. the words are these, <hi>There is none like to the God of Jeshurun, who rideth upon the heaven in thy help, and in his excellency on the sky. The eternal God is thy refuge, and underneath are the everlasting arms.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Penns</hi> words: <hi>If the God of Jeshurun be the true God, and none be like to him;</hi> then saith he, <hi>Cannot mans bodily shape be the likeness of the true God:</hi> and saith, <hi>consequently, If</hi> Muggletons <hi>God be in the likeness of mans bodily shape, he is not the true God, because he is not that God of Jeshurun which none is like unto.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Pag. 7. <hi>Penn</hi> saith, <hi>If the Almighty God were but of the dimention of a middle statured man, how could he be said to ride upon the heavens, and the sky, and to have his everlasting arms under a people, many of whom being singly bigger than himself:</hi> For by <hi>Muggletons</hi> Principles, saith he, we are still to keep to the literal sence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Muggletons</hi> Answer and Interpretation, to prove by Scripture, that the God of <hi>Jesurun</hi> was at that time when <hi>Moses</hi> spake those words in the Image likeness, and shape of mans body, and that the body of the first man <hi>Adam</hi> was created in the Image of God, in respect of his bodily shape, as well as his soul, for if the man <hi>Adams</hi> soul was created in the Image of God, his body was created and made in the Image of God also: For God gave every creature a body suitable to that life or soul he created; and seeing he hath said, that he hath made man his own Image, and hath denied all things which he hath made to be his Image but man
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:206971:5"/> only; so that mans body is the Image and likeness of God as well as his soul, else God would have made some distinction between them. For this, I say, if God should have made mans soul like himself, and his body of another shape, it would have been ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous for <hi>Moses</hi> to say that God made man in his own Image and likeness, if the body of man had not been the Image of God as well as his soul: Let the Reader consider that it is the life or soul that gives shape and form to all bodies whatsoever, both heavenly bodies, and earthly bodies, and without life and soul there can be no bodies at all, neither in heaven nor in earth; so that if God made man in his own Image and likeness, and breathed in him the breath of life, which was his holy nature, whereby man became a living soul: So that if the soul of <hi>Adam</hi> was of Gods holy nature, so was his body of Gods holy form, shape, and likeness; also else God did not make man in his own Image, he made but part of man in his own Image and likeness, and not the whole man, which is hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible wickedness for any man to affirm as wicked <hi>Penn</hi> the Quaker doth.</p>
            <p>For by his Assertion, he maketh God that great Negromencer or Cunjurer, to make the soul of man in his own Image, and his body of another shape. This Opinion of <hi>Penns</hi> hath been the cause that so many learned men hath studied the Art of Cunjuration and Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gromancy, and several curious Arts of that nature by the figure; and this Opinion hath been the cause of so many Witches, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining that Spirits may appear without Bodies, and Spirits raised without Bodies, as I have shewed more large in the Interpretation of the Witch of <hi>Endor.</hi> This opinion is it self more darker than Pitch.</p>
            <p>Again, if <hi>Penn</hi> the Quaker could separate the Image of God, the Soul of man, from the Body, and let me see Gods shape, image and likeness stand by it self, and the body that is not Gods image, shape, nor likeness stand by it self, as blind <hi>Penn</hi> saith; then all people might see what is Gods Image, and likeness, and what is not, and so mens minds would be satisfied, and know Gods Image, and likeness, when they see his Holy Nature or Seed stand by it self, and the body and shape of Man by it self, which <hi>Penn</hi> saith is another shape, and not the Image and likeness of God.</p>
            <p>Again, I shall prove by Scripture, that God himself was in the form and sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>pe of mans body from Eternity, or before t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> World was made, or before he created this visible World, and all other
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:206971:5"/> Creatures here below; and because the beginning of man is but as yesterday five thousand odd hundred years standing, and cannot comprehend by its reason what Eternity is, nor how to conceive that the Eternal Being, which we call God, should admit of any form, shape, or likeness at all in its own Being; yet the reason in man will call God the being of Beings, and that this Eternal Being hath given forms and shapes to all other Beings, but hath no form nor shape of its own. This is the Imagination of reason in man; this is the Angels nature that was cast down from Heaven upon this Earth, and this Imagination of reason is that which is reserved in chains of darkness until the judgment of the Great Day, and <hi>Willam Penn</hi> the Quaker is one of those Angels that was cast down in the seed of that reprobate Angel, who deceived <hi>Eve,</hi> and is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in chains of darkness until the Judgment of the great Day: This I know to be true.</p>
            <p>But to the matter in hand, to prove by Scripture, that God was in the form and shape of mans body as well as his soul, before the world was; I desire the Reader that things of this nature cannot be understood but by Faith: For as the reason in man is the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of things that are seen by the natural sight or light of the eye here in this world, as the natural light, sight, and understanding in man it doth distinguish things by their forms, and shapes: A Horse of one shape, a Cow of another; and so of Sheep and Dogs, and all other Creatures else here in this world that hath the breath of life in them, they are distinguished by their forms and shapes: Now if any of these creatures that have the breath of life in them, if they had no body, form, nor shape, how could you give that breath of life a name? what would you call it? As for example, a Horse hath the breath of life in him, and is a strong creature; Now if this Horse had no form nor shape, what would you call him, or what work would he do for you, if he had no body, shape, nor form for his breath of life to dwell in: For this I say, there is no breath of life can proceed, or have any being at all, but in a body and shape▪ for there is no shape in breath of life; and where there is no body n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r shape, there is no breath of life at all, for there can be no br<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>th of life at all without body, form and shape; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the reason of man hath given names to every creature that hath the breath of life in them, according to the form and natures of their bodies, and shape of them.</p>
            <p>So likewise <hi>Faith is the evidence of things not seen, and the subst<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nce
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:206971:6"/> of things hoped for;</hi> for as in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.3. <hi>Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen, were n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t made of things which do appear.</hi> So that by the spiritual and heavenly light of faith in man, he that hath faith in his heart, may see by the eye of faith, the form, nature, and sha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e of God who is Eternal, as man by his natural sight doth see the forms, natures and shapes of Creatures here upon earth, and that faith doth evidence to me, and all that hath true faith in them, that God was a glorious spiritual person, in form like a man from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, even as sure as the natural sight of man doth evidence to him, that he hath seen the faces, bodies and proportions of many men here upon earth; likewise faith is the evidence to me, that God made the glorious Angels, spiritual Bodies, in forms and shapes like man, and like his own form and shape, and that they are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, being spiritual Bodies, to ascend and descend at the pleasure of God, and at their own pleasure, and that these Angels are enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable, and that God made these Angels of that earth and waters above the Firmament of Heaven, even of that earth and Chrystal-waters, where his residence or person was eternally before this world of man was made.</p>
            <p>And that the Angels were all males in forms like man, not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease in number, nor decrease in number, but to give praise and glory unto God their Creator for ever and ever. Furthermore Faith is the evidence to me, that God created out of that Earth and Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stal waters aforesaid, all manner of Celestial Creatures in Heaven, as there is here upon Earth; so that God made all these Creatures here upon Earth in the beginning from that pattern in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens; so that God created the terrestal Creatures here on earth, as Horses Bulls, Lyons, Dragons, Rams, Dogs, Fish, and Foul, and all other Creatures that hath the Breath of Life, and Man to rule over them from that pattern of his creation in the Heavens of all manner of Celestial Creatures, and as Angels were Spiritual Bodies like unto God himself, but not of Gods own nature: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he made man of this terrestal earth, being of a more grosser matter, and breathed into him the breath of life, which was his own Nature, even the nature of Faith; so that the man <hi>Adam</hi> was created compleatly the Image and likeness of God both in form and nature, though an earthly terrestial man, answerable to the Angels bodies that were created, celestial, spiritual, and heavenly, according to the pattern God saw he had created in the Heavens;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:206971:6"/> only this is to be observed by the Reader, that all those Celestial Creatures which God created and made in the Heavens above, as well Angels as other Creatures, they were all created male Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, not to encrease, nor to decrease, as I said before; neither was there any female created in the Celestial Heavens.</p>
         </div>
         <div n="2" type="chapter">
            <head>CHAP. II.</head>
            <p>BEcause what creature soever God made in the Celestial Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens to set forth his glory, they were not to encrease and multiply, nor to decrease, die, and lessen, but to set forth their Creators glory for ever. For Female of all Creatures, as well as Women, God made on purpose to increase and multiply here in this World; so that one generation might pass away, and another come, even to the end of time: For as to increase and multiply had a beginning of time, as the creation of this world had a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of time; so there will be an end of time to this world, and an end of increasing and multiplying both of man, and of all other creatures whatsoever. Furthermore all those living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in Heaven above, did God create out of that earth and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters above the Stars, all manner of Celestial Creatures, with Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Bodies, every thing in its kind for his own glory, before it came into Gods heart to make this world, or to make man in his own Image. And further God made all Celestial Creatures in Heaven with Spiritual Bodies; and without a body did God make no living Creatu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e at all: neither did God make those Spiritual Creatures in Heaven of nothing, but he had matter to make them of: <hi>viz.</hi> Earth and Water, as aforesaid.</p>
            <p>So that by Faith a man may perfectly know what God was, and is in his form, shape, and nature from Eternity, and what form and nature Angels are of, and of what matter and substance God made Angels, and all other Celestial Creatures their spiritual bodies of in Heaven above the Stars, <hi>viz.</hi> of that gloriou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Earth, and Chrystal Seas, or waters above the Firmament of Heaven, the Scriptures are full to prove, the persons and nature of Angels, and the form, person, and nature of God; yet for want of faith, men understand them not, therefore I cannot expect that unbelieving men should understand what matter and substance God made all creatures in Heaven of, seeing the Scriptures hath not declared it as it hath the other; but the Faith that is of Gods own Nature, is not tied so as
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:206971:7"/> to know no more than what is written in publick: For true Faith is the substance of these things hoped for: by him that hath Faith in his heart, and the evidence of things, he never saw by the eye of reason, nor by the sight of the natural eye: I know these things will be looked upon by unbelieving men as idle tales, yet these things may be understood by faith, as well as <hi>Paul</hi> did under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand by faith that the Worlds were framed by the Word of God.</p>
            <p>So that the Reader may see, that God hath framed two Worlds by his Word; that is, the Celestial World, where none but Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Bodies are, and this Terrestial World, we now see, where none but Terrestial and Natural Bodies are, where is Mortality in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing and decreasing continually, as long as this World doth last; so that by Faith a man may as well understand, and know what substance and matter God made Angels, and all other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of in that world above, which is called the world to come, because it is yet to come to us, as to know by faith, that this world was framed by the Word of God, or had a beginning, or ever shall have an ending.

               </gap> by Faith a man may see as perfectly what God is in Heaven above the Stars, and what Crea ures God hath created there in a Celestial State, and what their forms, shapes and natures are, as really as a man may see the glory, persons, forms and shapes of Kings and Princes, and the forms, natures and shapes of all living Creatures under the Firmament of Heaven, by the eye of sence and reason. Thus the Reader may see that <hi>Faith is the substance of things hoped for, and the evidence of things not seen,</hi> by the eye of sence and reason.</p>
            <p>In the next place I shall interpret those Scriptures <hi>Penn</hi> brings to prove that God is not in the shape of a man in respect of his Body; and that man in respect of his body is not the Image of God. These are <hi>Penn's</hi> words, and the Scripture he brings to prove it, is <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.26, 27. where it is said, <hi>There is none like to the God of Jeshurun, who rideth upon the Heaven for thy help, and in his Excell<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Muggletons</hi> Answer and Interpretation let the Reader mind, that this place of Scripture doth no ways prove that God is not in the shape of a man, and that man in respect of his body is not the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of God, but doth prove altogether that man is the Image of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:206971:7"/> God in respect of his body as well as his Soul: Mind, that the God of <hi>Jeshurun</hi> spoken of here by <hi>Moses</hi> is that very same God <hi>Moses</hi> speaks of <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.26. <hi>And God said, Let us make man in our Image, after our likeness.</hi> In verse 27. <hi>So God created man in his own Image, in the Image of God created he him, male and female created he them.</hi> These words the Reader may see are plain: Now the Question is, Whether <hi>Moses</hi> did really believe when he wrote those words, that God <hi>made man in his own Image and likeness:</hi> I do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally believe that <hi>Moses</hi> his faith did cause him to speak as he did believe, as <hi>David</hi> said in another case, <hi>I believed, therefore I spake.</hi> And that <hi>Moses</hi> faith did see by Revelation that God was a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous spiritual body, in form and shape like a man, when God crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted man, and from Eternity, else <hi>Moses</hi> would never have writen those words without any destinction; &amp; this was the Prophets Faith, and the Apostles Faith, and I am of that Faith, being made Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the like pretious Faith and Revelation of <hi>Moses,</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise I know that <hi>Moses</hi> Faith was, that man in respect of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily shape, is made in the Image of God, and that Gods person, body and shape, though Heavenly, Spiritual and Glorious, was in Form and Shape like a man from Eternity, and is so still, and will be of the same Form and Shape to Eternity: I wonder how the Imagination of Reason in man, came to derogate from the sence of such plain positive words, to imagine the Soul of man to be the Image of God, and not of his Body; so that one half of man is the Image of God, and the other half not: I know the cause is, that the Imagination of all men in the world, are by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in Chains of darkness, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

               </gap>ll be reserved in Chains of darkness, until the Judgement of the great day; then shall all men know that God was in the Form and Shape of mans body, as well as his Soul, and that mans body was the Image of God as well as his Soul; but all men shall not see God Face to Face, only such as did believe he had a Face and Body in this Life.</p>
            <p>Secondly, This God of <hi>Jeshurun</hi> is the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the God of <hi>Isaac,</hi> the God of <hi>Jacob;</hi> the God of <hi>Jeshurun</hi> was the God of <hi>Jacob</hi> or of <hi>Israel,</hi> and God made <hi>Moses</hi> King in <hi>Jeshurun,</hi> that is <hi>Moses</hi> was made King to lead and guide the Inheritance of <hi>Jacob,</hi> in that he gave forth a Law to the Children of <hi>Israel,</hi> as you may see in the 4. and 5. verses of this Chapter. <hi>Moses commanded us a Law, even the Inheritance of</hi> Jacob: <hi>And he was King in</hi> Jeshu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run, <hi>when the Heads of the People, and the Tribes of</hi> Israel <hi>were
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:206971:8"/> gathered together.</hi> So that the God of <hi>Jeshurun</hi> was the God of <hi>Israel,</hi> or the God of <hi>Jacob:</hi> The same God that made man in his own Image, and that spake to <hi>Abraham, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and appear did unto them in the form of man, and made Covenants and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises unto them, that their Seed should be his Inheritance; And <hi>Moses</hi> was made King here on Earth, of the God of <hi>Jeshuruns</hi> Inheritance; so that this Scripture makes not to <hi>Penns</hi> purpose to prove, that man is not the Image of God in respect of his bodily shape, but altogther the contrary.</p>
            <p>In this Chapter, <hi>Moses</hi> blesseth the twelve Tribes of <hi>Israel,</hi> and blessing them, he instructed them and encouraged them to trust in that God, that had done so many wonderful things by his hand in in the midest of them: Saying, there was none, meaning no God like unto the God of <hi>Jeshurun,</hi> that is there was no God like unto the God of <hi>Jacob,</hi> God of <hi>Israel, who rideth upon the Heaven for thy help, and his Excellency on the Skie.</hi> 27. verse, <hi>The eternal God is thy refuge, and underneath are the everlasting Arms; and he shall thrust out the Enemy before thee, and shall say destroy them.</hi> What doth this signifie as to Gods Form, being like unto mans body, because there is no God like unto the God of <hi>Jeshurun;</hi> therefore shall we conclude, that mans body and shape was not made in the Image of God, as well as his Soul, because there is no other God, nor man can do those wonderful things, as the God of <hi>Jeshurun</hi> did; these words of <hi>Moses</hi> were only to encourage the People to trust in that God, that had brought them out of <hi>Egypt</hi> with a high hand, and parted the Red Sea that they might go on dry Land, and had thrust out their Enemies before them: So that these things they had experience of, might cause them to trust in the God of <hi>Israel,</hi> or in the mighty God of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and not rebel against him.</p>

            <p>BEcause there was no God could do such mighty works, not like unto the God of <hi>Jeshurun,</hi> even the God of <hi>Israel, who rideth upon the Heaven for their help, which no other God can do, and his Excellency on the Sky, to help his People</hi> Israel; for he could des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend in a Pillar of fire by night to help his People, and descend in the Pillar of a Cloud by day, to discomfort his Peoples Enemies; so that the God of <hi>Jeshurun</hi> being a spiritual body, can descend in a Cloud from the Sky, and ascend in a Cloud to the Sky agan, so
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:206971:8"/> that a spiritual body may be said, <hi>to ride upon the Skie in his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency,</hi> which no other God can do, and in this regard there is none like unto the God of <hi>Jeshurun,</hi> the God of <hi>Jacob,</hi> the eternal God who created man in his own Image, who <hi>Moses</hi> said in the 29. verse <hi>Happy art thou O</hi> Israel: <hi>who is like unto thee O People, saved by the Lord, the Shield of thy help, and so forth.</hi> This is the true Interpretation of these Scriptures, so that the God of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shurun</hi> is the same God that made mans body and shape, in his own glorious Image, and that the God of <hi>Jeshurun,</hi> which none was like unto; was at that time in form like a mans bodily shape, only Gods body was spiritual, heavenly and glorious; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore able to ride upon the Heaven, and upon the Sky, which no other God nor mortal man could do: Therefore none like unto the God of <hi>Jeshurun,</hi> the mighty God of <hi>Jacob,</hi> who made man in his own Image and likeness, in respect of his bodily shape, as well as his Soul. This was the true meaning of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> only this hint I would give the Reader to understand, that the Imagination upon the Heaven, and upon the Sky, without a body, when the unclean Spirit of Imagination goeth out of a man, it rideth upon the Sky without a body, seeking rest but can find none, so it returns into the body again, and there abides till death; because no rest can be had to any Spirit whatsoever without a body; therefore it is that none is like unto the God of <hi>Jeshurun,</hi> who rideth upon the Heaven, and upon the Sky with his Spiritual body and soul together, because his Spirit and Soul, though it be the eternal Spirit, it cannot be without a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy eternal also.</p>

            <p>I confess that <hi>Solomon</hi> was a Wise man in things of nature, beyond all that were before him, or shall come after him, even

            <p>
               <hi>Answer. Penn</hi> thinks he hath drawn a strong Argument from this Scripture, to prove, that God is not in the form of a man, nor of the stature of a man. This is right Antichristian-Quaker-like, which will give no m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>anings nor interpretation of Sc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: for an Interpreter must give meanings of words, else how shall men understand one anothers meanings. We see here in this world how necessary an Interpreter is where a man comes in a strange land, that the people of that land may know his meaning, and what he would have them to do for him. So likewise a l those people that are travelling to Heaven, seeking eternal life by searching the Scriptures, for in them people think to find eternal life; there is great need of an Interpreter to give them the meanings of the Scriptures, else they will be in the same condition as the Eunuch was in his Charet: The place of Scripture he read was this; <hi>He was lead as a sheep to the slaughter, and like a lamb dumb before the shearer, so opened he not his mouth,</hi> Acts 8.32. So <hi>Philip</hi> ran to the Charet, and said
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:206971:10"/> unto the Eunuch, <hi>Ʋnderstandest thou what thou readest?</hi> and he said, <hi>How can I except some man should guide me.</hi> That is, except some man interpret the Prophets words, and give me the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whether the Prophet meant himself, or some other; how should he understand Scriptures except some man do interpret them, and give meanings to them.

               </gap>d against God being in the form of man; and if I should do as he doth, give no meanings nor interpretation of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, what would my writings signifie; the Professors of the Scriptures would not be so offended at me as they are, for I could alledg seven places of Scripture to one of them <hi>Penn</hi> doth quote, that doth contradict those places he doth alledg, to prove his assertions he draweth from those Texts; but he gives no meaning nor interpretation, which is the cause they are so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable to all people, which doth neither offend the minds of people that are not of their belief, nor comfort those that do believe them, as experience hath shewed abundantly, as many can witness. But I know the gift of Interpretation and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Scripture words are profitable to all other men but to blind Anti-Christian Quakers, I know it is of no profit to them; therefore I do not interpret Scriptures, and give meanings for their sakes, but for those who shall come to understand interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and meanings of Scripture words, therefore I shall inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret the meaning of those words of the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>

            <p>This Prophecy was fulfilled when Christ began to Preach, and <hi>John Baptist</hi> began to baptise the Children of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Israel,</hi> at <hi>Jordan</hi> near <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> where the Sadduces and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees, that generation of Vipers, came to <hi>John's</hi> Baptism. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> in his Prophecy incourageth every man that believeth in the God of <hi>Israel,</hi> the mighty God of <hi>Jacob,</hi> to put their trust in him, and in no other God whatsoever, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause no other God is so Omnipotent and Powerful as the God of <hi>Israel;</hi> who by his Wisdom, Power, and Knowledg, <hi>mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sureth the waters in the hollow of his hand, and meted out heaven with the span, and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance.</hi> Now if this Scripture must have no interpretation nor meaning given of it, What gross absurdities will follow, <hi>viz.</hi> that the very palm or hollow of Gods hand is so big that it doth hold the great Seas, and great Rivers of waters in the hollow of his hand. By this Rule a man may inferr, that Gods hand is the Vessel or foundation to bear up the waters of the Sea; which indeed is nothing but the very Earth under the Waters, which <hi>Penn</hi> calls the hollow of Gods hand. Likewise <hi>Penn</hi> doth imagine, that Gods hand is so big that he can span from one end of Heaven to the other, and that Gods Comprehension and Understanding is so big and large a measure to hold all the dust of the earth in it, and that God is so big, even as a pair of Scales or Balance in which he hath weighed the great Mountains and the Hills in.</p>

            <p>REader, Suffer me a little to describe the Quakers Imaginary God without a body. <hi>Penn</hi> saith, God is an infinite, great, vast Spirit, without any form or shape at all, and holdeth the Waters in the hollow of his Hand. Now the hollow of this imaginary infinite Spirits hand, is that hollow earth that holdeth the great Seas, and waters of the Earth, this is the hand of an infinite Spirit that hath no body. 2. The Firmament of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, the substance of it is the Span of an infinite Spirit without a body. 3. That this infinite Spirit without a body can compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:206971:11"/> and understand, and hold all the dust of the Earth in its head, yet a Spirit without a body. 4. That this infinite vast Spirit without a body, can weigh the Mountains in Scales, and the Hills in ballance, without a head of understanding; here the Quakers God is described, he holdeth the Waters in the hollow of his hand, yet hath no hand. 2. He spanneth out the Heaven with his span, yet hath no Fingers nor Thumb. 3. He comprehends the dust of the Earth in a measure, yet hath no head. 4. He weigheth the Hills and Mountains in a ballance, yet hath no Arms, nor body: This is the Quakers God which they do worship, and this is the Quakers Faith, else <hi>Penn</hi> would never have brought this Scripture, to prove that God is not in the form of a man, nor no form at all.</p>
            <p>Yet the Scriptures speaks of God having all parts as a man hath, as here in this place the Prophet speaks of Gods hand, and of his comprehension, which must be in the head; <hi>Moses</hi> tells us of Gods face, thou canst not see my face and live, and Heaven is Gods Throne, and Earth is his Foot-stool, and that God hath a Nose and Breast, and Thighs and Arms and Fingers and right hand and left hand, the Sheep shall stand on his right hand, and the Goats on his left hand; these expressions the Scriptures are full off: Therefore it is for certain that <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets did belive and know, that God was in the form of man, when he said let us make man in our own Image; else the Prophets would never have talked so oft of Gods Face, Arms, Hands, Brest, Nose that smelled a sweet savour, Legs and Feet, if God had been no form at all, as <hi>Penn</hi> doth vainly i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine, and if it be granted that God was in any form at all, when he created this World; Is it not the safest and the best Faith, to believe he was in the form of a man, seeing he saith, he made man in his own Image and likeness, else those words of <hi>Moses</hi> cannot be true; for an infinite Spirit without body and shape, could never have made man in his own Image and likeness; except he had made man an infinite formless Spirit, without a body as himself is; as <hi>Penn</hi> doth affirm that God hath no form nor body, nor likeness at all but an infinite vast Spirit, that fills all places at one time, which in effect is an infinite nothing: For if God had no body nor form of his own at all, then it will follow, that he must be an infinite no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all; or else he must be the Earth, the Waters, the Air,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:206971:12"/> the Firmament, the Sun, the Moon, the Stars, the life of every Creature, both Rational and Sensitive and Vegitive Creatures, even the all in all; to conclude, there is nothing in Heaven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, nor in the Earth beneath, nor in the Waters, but God himsel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>; for if God cannot be confined to no particular place, as <hi>Penn</hi> saith, he must partake of the miseries here on earth, as well as the joys of Heaven: why, because he cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd to Heaven which is the Throne of Glory, but must be here on Earth his Foot-stool at the same time; so that no place is empty of Gods presence, no not so much as Hell, but God is present there at one and the same time. This is <hi>Penn</hi> the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers God, as doth appear by the inference he draweth from these Scriptures afore-mentioned.</p>
            <p>For the Readers sake, I shall interpret those words of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, how God may be said to have measured the waters in the hollow of his hand: The meaning is, That <hi>in the beginning when God created the heaven and the earth, the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters,</hi> Gen. 1.2. For the waters were over the face of the earth, and did cover the earth; therefore it is said, <hi>That darkness was upon the face of the deep waters;</hi> and Gods Spirit, that is the Word of his Power, moved upon the face of the waters; and by the voyce of God entring and moving upon the face of the waters, he created Light out of the substance of Water. For the Reader must mind, that by the Word of God the Worlds were framed. The Word of God may be called the Spirit of God, in that no word can be spoken but it must proceed from a spirit, and a spirit cannot utter words but from a body; so that there must be body, spirit and word, and all but one Being; neither can any one of these three be destroyed, but all three are destroyed; and if one of these three do live for ever, all three do live for ever, because they all three are but one entire distinct being of it self. But let that pass.</p>
            <p>So that God, by his Word, moving upon the face of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, he created by his Word out of that substance of water, the Sun, Moon, and Stars; by his Word he made them bodies of light: But before he made the Sun, Moon, and Stars; he created by his Word, out of those Waters, that was over the face of the deep, the Firmament of Heaven, it was made by the Word of God, out of that substance of water that was upon the face of the deep in the beginning; and this Firmament is
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:206971:12"/> called Heaven, which God made of that water that was over the face of the deep; and this Firmament which God created out of the substance of water, it doth compose the Globe of the earth round, so that the earth stands in the midst of the Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament; so that the Firmament is underneath the earth, as it is above the earth, and by the Word of the Lord the earth stand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hen he created it; only this observe, though God maketh the earth to stand upon nothing, yet he did not make the earth it self, the substance of earth of nothing, but the substance of earth was an Eternal Chaos; for God never made any thing of nothing, though he maketh a substance to stand or hang upon nothing: And those bodies of light, the Sun, Moon, and Stars, God set them in the Firmament of Heaven, to give light upon the earth; And after God had made the Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament of Heaven, and those lights aforesaid out of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of that waters that was over the face of the earth, then God said to the residue of the waters, <hi>Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear: and it was so.</hi> (As in verse 9.) This one place where the waters were gathered together was the hollow of Gods hand, because God by his Word caused the waters to gather together into that place he appointed them, even to that one place they now remain: And this was Gods handy work, and in this sence God may be said to have measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, because he prepared a place in the earth by his Word speaking, to hold the waters in a hollow place in the earth, both deep and large, to hold these deep waters in this deep place in the earth, and these waters are called Sea; so that the deep, that holdeth the waters of the Sea, may be called the hollow of Gods hand; and that he doth hold the waters of the Sea in the hollow of his hand, because he keepeth the waters of the Sea in i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>ANd as for Gods meting out the Heaven with a span, that was when God created the Heaven in the beginning, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.1. The Heaven is the Firmament, as I said before, and God hath by his Wisdom and Power of his word, meted out the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Heaven, to compass the Earth, as I said before; and being Gods handy work in the Creation, at the beginning it may properly be said, that he hath spanned out the Firmament with his span; and whereas he comprehended the dust of the Earth in a measure: That was when God had by his word speaking, caused the Waters to be gathered into one place, then the dry Land did appear, as in verse 9. and it was so, then God could comprehend the dust of the Earth in a measure, why be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he could then see the length and breadth of it, and did see that the dust of the Earth, would be a place fit for all mortal Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which he intended to make to live in, and God did mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in his wisdom and understanding and Counsel, the length and breadth of this dry Land that did appear, and God knew it would serve for a good use, for mortal Creatures to live and inhabite in, to set forth his glory in the Creation; and in this sence God may be said to comprehend the dust of the Earth in a measure.</p>
            <p n="3">3. God may be said to have weighed the Mountains in Scales, and the Hills in a balance, that is, when the waters were ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered tnto one place, by the word of the Lord in the beginning, then did the Mountains and Hills appear in sight, and when God saw them he weighed the great Mountains and the lesser, in the balance of his mind, and he saw that the Mountains and Hills of the Earth, would be very good, and useful for those Creatures he did intend to create; for the Hills and Mountains of the Earth were covered with water, before the Spirit of God moved upon the waters, in the beginning when God created this visible world, as it was in the days of <hi>Noah</hi> when the world was drowned, as may be seen, <hi>Gen.</hi> 7.19, 20. <hi>And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the Earth, and the Ark went upon the face of the Waters: Atd the Water prevailed exceedingly upon the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:206971:13"/> Earth, and all the high Hills that were under the whole Heavens were covered,</hi> fifteen Cubits upwards did the Waters prevail, and the Mountains were covered: Thus the Hills and Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains were covered with Water, before God created this world, in the beginning as <hi>Moses</hi> doth declare; and in this sence God may be said to have weighed the Mountains in Scales, and the Hills in a balance of his own Wisdom, Counsel and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing; and yet the person of God, no biger then a middle statured man; this is the true interpretation and meaning of the Prophet <hi>Isaiahs</hi> words: Much more might be said in this point but it would be too large, hoping that the Readear will under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand what is written as to this point.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Penn quotes Isa.</hi> 40.18, 19, 21, 22.

This is understood by Faith only, as I said before; this is the true meaning of the Prophets words: And this God of <hi>Israel</hi> that did these great things in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, was he that made man in his own Image and likeness; and that the living God was before he made man in the form and likeness of man, and in no other form and likeness, only his body was spiritual, heavenly and glorious, as I said before.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer.</hi> Here the Reader may see the black darkness of this Anti-Christian-Devil, <hi>Penn</hi> the Quaker: That because Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smiths, or other Crafts-men may make the Image of a man, and so make the Image and likeness of God; therefore God must have no body nor form of his own at all. Let the Reader con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, that if God hath no body nor form of his own, he is in a worse condition than the Creatures which he hath made; for
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:206971:15"/> he hath made all creatures that hath the breath of life in them with bodies, and the body and life of all creatures doth rejoyce and are glad; and without a body there can be no life, nor joy, neither in God, Angels, nor Man, nor no other creature that hath the breath of life. Now shall any man that is not stone blind in his understanding, believe that God who created and made all things with bodies, and yet himself hath no body at all, but is an infinite vast Spirit without any body or form, or shape at all of his own? A man may as well say, that a spirit without a body may build all the Churches in <hi>London</hi> that were burned down by the Fire: as to say, that God who created the two Worlds Celestial and Terrestial, and the creatures therein; had no body of his own: Or a man may as well take a beautiful spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited Woman without a body to his Wife, and see how he can love a spirit without a body. This is as possible for man to do, as it is for Gods Spirit to be without a body: nay, it is as possible for the spirit of a man to build a Tower without its body, as it is for God to create the two Worlds, and all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures therein, without a body of his own. Again, if God hath never a body of his own, but is an infinite vast Spirit without any body at all, and yet he fills Heaven, and Earth, and the Heaven of Heavens cannot contain him; Where then is God contained? Sure he is contained some where? And if the Heaven of Heavens cannot contain him, he is of such a vast bigness; Sure the imagination of man doth imagine Gods Spirit to be bigger than it is: It is a marvellous thing to me now, that a Spirit without a body should be in all places at one and the same time, and fill Heaven and Earth also. But by Faith I know that Gods body is no bigger than a middle statured man, and that his Godhead Spirit is contained in that body; only but this Wisdom, Power and Glory, doth fill Heaven and Earth, neither doth the Heaven and Heaven of Heavens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his power and glory; for he is as well by his power on Earth, by his Mercies to some, and his Judgements to others; nay his Power is in Hell also with the damned, so that Gods power is every where at once, in that he hath written a Law in the Seed of every Creature, both in Heaven above, and in the Earth beneath, and in the Waters under the Earth; and in this sense, God may be said to fill Heaven and Earth, and that the Heaven of Heavens cannot contain him; but as to the person
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:206971:16"/> and body of God himself, he is contained now in the Heavens only, and his person is contained when he pleases, in a lesser compass then a mans person can be contained.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Penn</hi> the Quaker, hath imagined God to be an infinite Spirit, without a body, of such a vast bigness, that the Heaven of Heavens, nor the Earth cannot contain him; his Spirit is so big that it cannot be confined to any particular place; by this Assertion God is contained in the Air, and in the Earth, and in the Waters, and in the Beasts of the Field, and in the Fowls of the Air, and in the Fish in the Sea, and in man, and in the Shape of the Trees, and Grass of the Field; by <hi>Penns</hi> Assertion God is in all these, by his great vast Spirit without a body, for he imagines that God is the life of every thing; so that the Trees could not grow, if Gods Spirit were not in the Sap of them, and so of all things else: Thus ridiculous is learned <hi>Penns</hi> conceit of Gods gseatness, so that God must be beholding to the bodies of the Creatures, which he hath made to dwell in; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he hath never a body of his own big enough, for his great vast Spirit to live in; Is not this an absurd Faith, that <hi>Penn</hi> the Quaker holds forth, let all sober men Judge.</p>
            <p>Mind Reader, that because <hi>Reeve</hi> and <hi>Muggleton</hi> doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that God is but in the form &amp; stature, and bigness of a man, as is said by <hi>Moses,</hi> and that a man may Carve, and make the Image of man, and so the Image of God, of Wood or Stone, and worship it for God; so that man may make the Image and likeness of God, as they do the Image and likeness of Angels, and other Creatures; must it therefore follow, that because Gods Image and likeness, is made in the form of mans bodily shape, as is most true it is; must men worship this Image as God, and believe the Image he hath made to be a God; this is great blindness and horrid Idolatry, so that because there may be an Image of God made by man: Therefore <hi>Penn</hi> will not have God to have any body or form at all, but an infinite form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less nothing, so that no Image can be made of an infinite no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, this is <hi>Penns</hi> God that he doth worship, and wnile he seems to worship a God that hath no form at all, he becomes the greatest Idolator of all, and worships every form for God, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

God loved his holy Faith, being his own nature, and his obedience to the legal Law written in his heart; so that God walked with <hi>Enoch,</hi> and revealed his secrets unto him, and shewed unto him that God was in the form of man from Eternity, and <hi>Enoch</hi> walked with God, in that he did believe God was in a glorious form like man from Eternity, and in that he did obey Gods Law written in his heart; so that his righteousness did exceed all men that were upon the earth at that time; so that God revealed unto him glorious things, in that he gave him to know that God was in the form of man, a spiritual body; and gave him the spirit of prophecy, that this spiritual body should be transmitted into a pure natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral body, so that God should be upon this earth, and eat and drink with man as a man. This, and many other wonderful things did <hi>Enoch</hi> prophecy of concerning God in the books of <hi>Enoch,</hi> which <hi>Noah, Abraham, Lot, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and the twelve sons of <hi>Jacob</hi> did read, as may be seen in the testimony of the twelve sons of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and in the Scriptures, that maketh mention of <hi>Enoch,</hi> and how he was translated.</p>
            <p>Observe his Body was translated and immortallized as well as his Soul, and his Body went to Heaven as well as his Soul; for this I say; there n ver was any soul or spirit that went to heaven without a bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:206971:20"/> without bodies, because his spirit cannot be without a body himself, nor no other creature he hath made in heaven nor in earth; so that what spirits soever goeth to heaven without bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, God will surely cast them out of heaven for ever. So that it may be clear to the Reader that hath Faith to understand the Scriptures, that <hi>Enoch</hi> did know and believe God to be in the form of mans bodily shape, a spiritual body, and that this spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual body would transmute it self into a pure natural body, which was Christ, and that this Christ should be the very God that should eat and drink with man as man, and that the seed of the Serpent should put him to death. Now if the man Christ Jesus his body and soul was the Lord of Life, as the Scripture saith; then certainly he was God when he was upon earth, and his soul suffered death, as the Scriptures are full to prove: But I shall speak more fully to this hereafter. Likewise it may be clear to the Reader, that no soul nor spirit can go to heaven without its body, and that <hi>Enoch</hi> his body was translated with his soul, and so went both to heaven, being but one personal substance, neither can they be seperated one from the other. This is a standing truth, but few understand and believe it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. See <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.8. <hi>But Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord, and Noah was a just man, and perfect in his generation, and Noah walked with God.</hi> So <hi>Gen.</hi> 8.20. <hi>And Noah builded an altar unto the Lord, and took of every clean beast, and every clean foul, and offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed burnt offerings on the altar.</hi> And vers. 21. <hi>And the Lord smelled a sweet savour, and the Lord said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for mans sake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here the Reader may see, that <hi>Noah</hi> was a just and perfect man in his generation, in so much that he found grace in the eyes of the Lord, in that he walked with God. So that God revealed himself to him, because he had Faith to believe God, and he acted the righteousness of the Law written in his heart towards man. For this is to be minded, that God always chuse such men, and revealed himself unto them that were righteous in their generation; and if <hi>Reeve</hi> and <hi>Muggleton</hi> had not been innocent and free from the breach of the Law written in our hearts, and righteous in our generation in these last times, when so much wickedness hath been acted by the Professors of godliness in these times; God would never have chosen us,

            <p>BUt the Serpent said as much by the Lord himself when on Earth, as they do by us, but let that pass. Here the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may see that <hi>Noah</hi> did believe and know that God was in form like a man, because he found grace in his eyes; for <hi>Noah</hi> knew that a spirit without a body had not eyes nor heart to shew favor: but that God that was in the Image and likeness of himself, who had eyes in his head to see that <hi>Noah</hi> was righteous before him, Gods heart did love him, and shewed favor unto him, and gave him Revelation, knowledg and understanding of himself, and of his form and nature, and to be a Preacher of Righteousness. So that by Faith towards God, and righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness towards man, he walked with God as <hi>Enoch</hi> did, but was not tranflated as <hi>Enoch</hi> was, but died, and is in the earth at this day; so that he shall not go to heaven until all the rest of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of the Lord go to heaven, but his flesh doth rest in hope, as <hi>David</hi> saith, until the Resurrection.</p>
            <p>Likewise we see, that <hi>Noah</hi> was in such a high esteem with God, that when he offered up Sacrifices to him, he was so well pleased with it, that the Lord said he smelled a sweet savour; insomuch the Lord said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for mans sake; here we see God hath a Nose to smell, and a heart to promise; so that except a man were stone blind, he could not deny God to be in the form and likeness of man; for a Spirit without a Body hath no Nose to smell, nor Heart to promise, but is without form and void of all sence, it can neither hear, see, nor smell, nor taste, nor handle, nor speak, nor walk, but is an eternal stilness, as I have heard several of the Ranters say; and <hi>Penns</hi> God and his Faith is the same as the Ranters is, this I know to be true.</p>

            <p>They according to the writings of <hi>Enoch</hi> did seat up Priests unto God after that time that <hi>Melchizedek</hi> had blessed <hi>Abraham,</hi> with the Titles of <hi>Melchizedek,</hi> the Priest of the most high God, and they did offer up Sacrifices by this Priest, as unto <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chizedek;</hi> and they called the Priest <hi>Melchizedek,</hi> the Priest of the most high God, and they payed Tyths to this Priest, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Melchizedek</hi> the Priest of the most high God, as they did af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to the Priesthood of <hi>Aaron;</hi> a hint of this may be read in the Testimony of the twelve Patriarchs at their deaths: For <hi>Abraham</hi> was going after the slaughter of Kings, to give the tenth of the spoil, unto that <hi>Melchizedek</hi> the Priest; as no doubt but he had done several times before, as in the 20. verse, and gave him Tythes of all; but this <hi>Melchizedek</hi> King of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> who brought Bread and Wine, as the Priest of the most high God, who blessed <hi>Abraham</hi> was God himself, onely to signifie unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> and those of the Faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that in the fulness of time he would take upon him the Seed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> in the Womb of a Virgin, and so become very man to offer up himself unto sin and death, and to rise again the third day, and so become an high Priest after the order of <hi>Melchizedek;</hi> he that can understand this Mystery, let him understand.</p>
            <p>For it may be clear to the Seed of Faith, that this <hi>Melchizedek</hi> King of <hi>Salem,</hi> which blessed <hi>Abraham,</hi> was God the Father and Creator of all things, as we may be seen <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.1. <hi>For</hi>

            <p>Here it is clear, that this <hi>Melchizedek</hi> that met <hi>Abraham</hi> and blessed him, was God the Father, and Creator of all things; and it may be as clear to those that have the true light of Faith in them, that this <hi>Melchizedek,</hi> the Eternal God, was in the form of a man; and further, it is plain, that God himself did officiate the office of a Priest himself, and took upon himself the title of the Priest of the most High God, notwithstanding he was the most high God himself; and he acted as God to <hi>Abraham,</hi> even as a friend of God, and gave him Bread and Wine to comfort him, and blessed him.

            <p>ANd as for his being made like unto the Son of God, abideth a Priest continually; that was to signifie to <hi>Abraham</hi> that this <hi>Melchizedek</hi> the Eternal God would take upon him the seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and would become a Son of <hi>Abraham;</hi> and as he had been <hi>Abrahams</hi> Father, so he would in the fulness of time become <hi>Abrahams</hi> Son; and this Jesus Christ was that <hi>Melchizedek</hi> that took upon him <hi>Abrahams</hi> seed, and became <hi>Abrahams</hi> Son, and <hi>Abraham</hi> became Gods Father. This is the mystery of God indeed, yet the Scripture is full to prove it; for this Christ is called the Son of <hi>David,</hi> the Son of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Son of <hi>Seth,</hi> the Son of <hi>Adam,</hi> the Son of God.</p>
            <pb n="34" facs="tcp:206971:22"/>
            <p>Now mind that all these men were called the Sons of God before God took upon him the seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> in the Virgins womb; but when that child Jesus was born of a Virgin, then those men aforesaid were called his Fathers; so that <hi>David</hi> in spirit called his Son Christ Lord, and yet he knew at that time by the spirit of Prophecy that God would take his seed upon him, and become his Son, and call himself Christ; for God took not upon him the nature of Angels, but the seed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> that is, he took upon him the seed of Faith that was in <hi>Abraham,</hi> and not the nature of Angels, which is the seed of pure reason in the Angels; so that God took upon him his own nature that he breathed into <hi>Adam,</hi> even the breath of life that became seed in him, that is, the seed of Faith: Therefore <hi>Adam</hi> is called the Son of God, and God is called <hi>Adams</hi> Son, and <hi>Adam</hi> is called Gods Father, in that Christ is called th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>These are plain proofs of Scripture, to prove that God was in the form of man from Eternity, and that he made man in his own Image and likeness in respect of his bodily shape; because God always appeared to the Fathers of old, though a spiritual body, in the form and shape of mans body; neither did God ever appear in any other shape, but the shape of man, because it was his own shape: for it would have been a ridiculous thing for God to make man in his own image and likeness, and he himself to have no body, form nor likeness at all: Which way then could he have had any converse with man, neither could man have had converse with God; for an Infinite Spirit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any body, could never appear to man, nor converse with man, nor bless man: What blessing can a spirit without a body give to any man that hath a body.</p>

            <p>FOR though Christ said, <hi>That God is a Spirit, and those that worship him, must worship him in spirit and in truth:</hi> he knowing that God is a spiritual body, therefore said to be a Spirit; and that man is a natural body, therefore he must worship this God that hath a spiritual body, in spirit and in truth of heart that is in mans natural body; for he that worships God that hath a spiritual body of his own, doth worship God in spirit and in truth;
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:206971:29"/> and no man can worship God in spirit and in truth of heart with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a body; so that if God were a spirit without a body; a man may as well be a spirit without a body, and may worship such a God in spirit and truth without a body, which is ridiculous and inconsistent with Reason; but she understood that God was a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual body in heaven, and that his body and spirit was one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal God, and that her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And those that do so doth worship God in spirit and in truth, so that if na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural bod es and natural spirits can worship God in spirit and in truth, it will follow that God is a spiritual person also. More might be said in this, but I shall pass it by.</p>
            <p>Likewise <hi>Penn</hi> quotes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. <hi>For what the Law could not do in that it was weak through tho flesh, God sending his own Son in the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of sinful flesh, for sin condemned sin in the flesh, but made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the forme of a servant, and was made in the likeness of man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Penns</hi> Reply to this: He grants that Christ took upon him, not only the shape of a man, but the flesh and blood of a Virgin, and saith the Question will then be this, <hi>Whether Christ had this shape be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he took it:</hi> And in <hi>page</hi> 9. <hi>Penn</hi> saith, <hi>God is not in the likeness of sinful flesh, nor made in the likeness of man:</hi> And in <hi>page</hi> 10. <hi>Penn</hi> saith, <hi>To conclude, if he, will interpret Gods Hands, Armes and Span, to signifie his Power, as is most true,</hi> saith he: <hi>Then,</hi> saith <hi>Penn, I will also explain Gods Image to be Holiness, which,</hi> saith he, <hi>is also true.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer.</hi> Here <hi>Penn</hi> grants, that God sent his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh;— Observe, if Christ were Gods own Son then he was the express Image of his Fathers Person, he being the only begotten Son of God; and if the Son were in the forme of man, then he that begot him must n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eds be in the forme and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:206971:30"/> shape of man also:— for a spirit without a body could never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get a son with a body like man, for every thing begets its like; so that if God begot a Son in his own likeness, and that in the shape of Man, as the Scripture saith; then it will follow, that God the Father of Christ was in the forme and shape of Man before he begot him: neither can <hi>Pauls</hi> words be true, except God hath a body, forme and shape of his own, because he hath begot a Son in the Womb of a Virgin, in the forme of man, nay, very man. And this Man Christ Jesus is said to be the express Image and bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Gods Person: so tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>Paul</hi> did conclude, that Gods Person was in the forme of mans bodily shape, as is most true. Is it not gross ignorance for a man to say, That God was in no form nor shape when he made Man in his own Image and likeness, seeing he hath begot a Son since, that which is the express Image and brightness of Gods Person; and what testimony can be more sure, to prove that God was in the forme of Man, in respect of bodily shape, from Eternity: but be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ause Jesus Christ his only begotten Son, was in the forme and shape of man when he was upon earth, and when he was in the liken<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ss of sinful flesh, he was at that same time the express Image, and brightness of Gods Person; and he doth retain that body, forme and shape still in heaven: so that the visible Body of Christ is sufficient to p ove, that God had a Body like man when he made Man in his own Image and likeness in respect of his bodily shape: Let the Reader consider, did ever <hi>Moses,</hi> the Prophets, Apostles or Christ himself, pray to a spirit without a body: Did Christ say, <hi>Father, if it be possible let this Cup pass from me, Not my Will but thy Will he done.</hi> Did he pray these words to an infinite spirit without any body, that can neither hear, see nor be confined to no particular place, what need soever his Son had of his help. All this will not convince the spirits of these blinde <hi>Quakers</hi> that carrieth their God within them, who are hardned in their hearts, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was, for eternal dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Penn</hi> doth confess, that this Son of God took upon
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:206971:30"/> him the forme of a servant and was made in the likeness of man Thirdly, <hi>Penn</hi> doth confess that Christ took upon him not only the shape of a man, but the flesh and blood of a Virgin, and sai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h the Question will then be this;— Whether Christ had that shupe before he took it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer:</hi> That the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of God is all one and the same spirit, this the Quakers doth acknowledge, and think none that doth own the Scriptures doth deny:— And if it be granted, that the Spirit of Christ and the Spirit of God are but one spirit, as is most true: then this will be the result, that when Christ took upon him the forme of a servant and was made in the likeness of man: God also took upon him the forme of a servant, and was made in the likeness of man also. Secondly, Christs spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and Gods spirit being but one spirit, then when Christ took not only the shape of a man, but the flesh and blood of a Virgin also; for God and Christ were always together, and never were divided nor separated one from the other in thems<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lves, though it seemeth otherwise to us.</p>
            <p>And to Answer your Question, whether Christ had the shape of a man before he took it of the Virgin; To this I say, he had the shape of a man from Eternity: and this Christ was he that said, <hi>Let us make man in our own Image and likeness.</hi> This he spake in relation to a twofold condition, that is, he was now when he made man in the Creation in a ipiritual, heavenly and glorious estate and condition in the Throne of the Father and Creator, the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, the great Jehovah:— but <hi>I</hi> will become a childe in the womb of a Virgin, and will take upon me the same seed of <hi>Adam,</hi> when I created him, even the seed of faith, which <hi>I</hi> sowed in his heart in the day when I created him, even my own seed of faith, and I will become in the condition of a servant, and will be found in the shape of man, and be as a servant to my own crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, though I made them all, and am Lord of them all, yet I will be as a servant to all; so that Christ had the shape of man before
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:206971:31"/> he took upon him the forme of a servant, and the flesh and blood of a Virgin:— but flesh, blood and bone he had not, before he took upon him the s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> for flesh, blood and bone is proper only to natural bodies, and not to spiritual bodies.</p>
            <p>So that God hath been in two states and conditions, but his fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>me and shape hath be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n all one, even the forme, Image and likeness of man: so that it may be clear to those that hath the true light of faith in them that Christ was in the forme and shape of mans Body, before he took the flesh and blood of a Virgin</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>page</hi> 9. <hi>Penn</hi> saith, God is not in the likeness of sinful flesh, nor made in the likeness of men: Observe, a little before he did own, that Christ the only begotten Son of God was found in the shape of man, and that he took upon him the flesh and blood of a Virgin, and took upon him the forme of a servant, and that God sent his Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and that Gods Son was made of no reputation. Fourthly, <hi>page</hi> 10. <hi>Penn</hi> saith, To conclude, if he will interpret Gods Hands, Armes and Span, to signifie his Power, as is most true: then saith <hi>Penn,</hi> will I also explain Gods Image to be holiness, which, saith he, is also true.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer.</hi> I do acknowledge that Gods Hands, Armes and Span doth signifie his Power, as is most true: but this I say, there can be no Power without a spirit of Wisdom and Understanding, and there can be no spirit of Wisdom and Understanding without a body, that hath Hands and Armes, that can span out the heavens by his Wisdom, and lay the foundation of the earth with his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, this wisdom and und<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Likewise in Christ was life eternal, and his life was the light of men, and <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> was sent to bear witness of the light, that all men through him might believe.— Now <hi>Iohn</hi> pressed no man to believe in any other God, but this Iesus Christ that was the true light that enlightneth every man that cometh into the world.

Now who could make the world but God, therefore Christ must needs be God as well as man; he that made the world, and was in the world, and the world knew him not; so that the world could not know Christ to be God and man, but some few he chose out of the world did know that Christ was God and man, and that he only had the words of eternal life: and further, they did know that this Christ was that Word that was made flesh, and dwelt among them, and they saw his glory but as the glory of the only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten of the Father, full of grace and truth. Thus the Reader may see, that doth understand Prophecy, Revelation and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of Scripture, that Christ is both God and man in one single person, forme and likeness of man.</p>

            <p>Thus I have given the interpretation of Gods six days work, and how that the substance of Earth and Water was eternal, in their being an essence; and how that God out of these two sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of earth and water, did create or made all things what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever; all the light of Sun, Moon, Stars, and Firmament of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, with all their bodies, and all other creatures whatsoever. that hath the breath of life in them, and that God did not make any thing whatsoever of nothing, as <hi>Penn</hi> doth blasphemously af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, so that the R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Sec ndly, it is an opinion of the Learned, that those substances Earth and Water were not eternal, but they have imagined that the Creator spake the Word and so they came to be: and after he had given them their being, he formed all things that were made out of them. Thirdly, there is no Scripture that maketh mention of any such thing, as Gods giving being to earth and watet. Fourthly, neither can it be proved by Scripture, that God gave being to the vast dead earth, and dark deep water: neither did those two substances of earth and water proceed out of Gods Mouth, but their being in the Original was eternal, and will be eternal. Fifthly, there is not a word throughout the scriptures, that God gave any being or beginning unto dead, dark, senseless earth and water. Sixthly, can <hi>Penn</hi> tell where God was resident when he gave a being to earth and water, for earth and water were uncreated substances eternally distinct from God. Seventhly, that earth and water were an eternal Chaos of confused matter, essentially distinct from God the Creator. Throughout the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, no man can finde one word or tittle in reference to the deep waters its beginning, therefore of necessity it must be eternal.

            <p>In <hi>Page</hi> 16. <hi>Penn</hi> saith, 'That this is contrary to Scripture-Testimony he will prove: His first pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>of is, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 12.7 the words are these, <hi>the spirit to God that gave it: Penns</hi> Argument upon these words, saith he, 'No carnal generation can bring forth a pure spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, external matter producing only external matter of its own kind, but, saith he, the soul of man is a spirit, as the words ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd by <hi>Reeve</hi> and <hi>Muggleton,</hi> saith he, therefore no man gets the soul or spirit of a man when he generates the body. Secondly, <hi>Penn</hi> saith, 'That which returns to God came from God, but the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:206971:43"/> soul of every man turns to God for sentence, and consequently came from him. This is all the Scripture <hi>Penn</hi> brings to prove the soul is not generated with the body.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer,</hi> First, that place, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 12.7. is no Scripture, as I have shewed before, they are the words of <hi>Solomon;</hi> he was no Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of holy Writ, neither did he know himself from whence the soul of man came, nor whither the soul goeth, no more then <hi>Penn</hi> doth, for the soul of a man and the soul of a beast was all one to <hi>Solomon,</hi> and their breath was all one, and they went both to one place; the one went to God as well as the other: neither had man any preeminence above a beast in <hi>Solomons</hi> judgement, and <hi>Penn</hi> is of the same mind of <hi>Solomon,</hi> so that <hi>Penns</hi> Argument from that place signifies nothing to this purpose, That the soul is not generated with the body.</p>
            <p>But I shall prove by Scripture, that the soul is generated and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten by man and woman with the b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And the Lord God formed Man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his Nostrils the breath of life, and Man became a living soul; <hi>Penns</hi> words to this, saith he, If the breath of life made a dead body live, then the priva<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Penns</hi> words to this; saith he, if the life was withdrawn when the body lay dead, saith he, but the soul was separated; and when it did return, and had resumed its forsaken dead body, it revived the dead body again, and saith, therefore the soul died not with the body at all.

            <p>
               <hi>Penns</hi> words to this; saith he, If their souls lived after their bodies were slain, then they did not die together; for they cried for vengeance on the blood-thirsty inhabitants of the world; saith he, therefore souls are not mortal as bodies are; and saith, in short their bodies were slain, their souls were alive; their bodies were in the Grave, their souls under the Altar worshipping God day and night for ever and ever: These are the most consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Scriptures and Arguments <hi>Penn</hi> doth alledge against the mortality of the soul.</p>

            <p>Fourthly, <hi>Penn</hi> quotes <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.9. <hi>And when he had opened the fifth Seal, I saw under the Altar the souls of them that were slain for the Word of God, and for the Testimony which they held,</hi> ver. 10. <hi>And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long Lord holy and true, dost thou not avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth.</hi>

               </gap> clear, that the soul of man is mortal, and doth die, because it was their souls that were slain under the Altar; and <hi>Iohn</hi> could not properly nor truly have said, that their souls were slain under the Altar, if their souls had been immortal, and had slipt out of their bodies, and were not slain at all.</p>
            <p>So that their souls had no cause at all to cry unto God for ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, seeing their souls were not slain, their souls were only turned out of their bodies, and sent to a better place, even to God himself; for if it were as <hi>Penn</hi> saith, that their bodies were slain, and their souls were alive, their bodies were in the grave and their souls under the Alrar worshipping God day and night for ever and ever: how contrary is this to reason it self, if it were as <hi>Penn</hi> saith, then those that were slain under the Altar had more cause to cry unto God for a blessing upon those Persecutors that shed their blood, why, because they did but let their souls out of the blood of their bodies, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Therefore let the Reader consider, that the life is in the blood, and the life doth subsist in the blood, and the life is the fire, heat and warmness of the blood; now if the blood be shed, the fire, heat and warmness of the blood goeth out, so that the blood groweth cold, and the cause why the blood is c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:206971:57"/> Scriptures doth testifie, and as I have proved at large in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going discourse.</p>
            <p>I perceive <hi>Penn</hi> hath read, some old Authors Books that hath judged this heresie also; but he that leaneth upon their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that condemned the truth of God for heresie, will surely perish to eternity, for they would have said as much by Christ himself had they lived in his time.</p>

            <p>For this is to be minded by the Reader, that God said in the Commandment, He would visit the sins of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hated him; Therefore it was a Proverb among the people of the Jews, that if children that had fathers that were wicked, the children of those fathers were heartless to work righteousness themselvs, seeing the sins of their fathers must be visited upon them to the third a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>So that this Scripture doth relate only to a legal righteousness, and to a legal punishment, and being put to death by legal <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

This is the true interpretation and meaning of this Scripture, and that this place doth no ways relate to Election and Reprobation to Eternity in the least.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Penn</hi> quotes 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.3, 4. the words are these, <hi>For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour,</hi> ver. 4. <hi>Who will have a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:206971:59"/> their thoughts to find the inside of man, but that their souls were slipt out before they were opened. This is only a word by the way, to shew that <hi>Penn</hi> is grosly ignorant of the Scripture, that did not reade <hi>Pauls</hi> mighty strong Arguments for Election and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation; and quote these words of <hi>Paul</hi> to overthrow all that <hi>Paul</hi> had written before; because <hi>Paul</hi> saith, this is good and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable in the sight of God our Saviour, who will have all men to be saved, and come unto the knowledge of the truth.</p>
            <p>This doth not disprove Gods Election; but <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh these words only to encourage men to believe in Iesus Christ, in as much as we Apostles are Ministers of Christ to preach life and salvation by believing in him, we are willing that all men that hear us should come to the knowledge of the truth and be saved, for we not knowing who is Gods Elect, and who is not, but by their belief or unbelief of our doctrine: and it is our desire, that all that hear us might believe us, as well as some, and be saved, and in this sense the Apostle might say it would be acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour, who will have all men to be saved, and come unto the knowledge of the truth; but when <hi>Paul</hi> saw that some men did bel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eve his doctrine, and some men did not believe but persecuted his doctrine, he knew then them to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected to salvation that received his doctrine, and those to be te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probated to damnation, that did reject, despise and persecute his doctrine, which made him wish himself accursed ftom Christ for his Friends and Kindred in the flesh; he was so sensible, that his Kindred in the flesh were of the reprobate-seed, and pre-ordained of God to be blinded and hardned, to oppose the truth, that they might be damned to eternity: if <hi>Paul</hi> had not known this, he would never have wished himself accursed from Christ for their sakes, but that he knew himselfe el<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:206971:60"/> Therefore it is said in Scripture, that as many as were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to eternal life believed; this <hi>Paul</hi> was sensible of, and could not alter his Decree in Reprobation, no more then he could in Election. This is the true interpretation and meaning of <hi>Pauls</hi> words in this place.</p>

            <p>This is the whole strength <hi>Penn</hi> hath, and Scripture he hath brought, to prove that this Principle of Election and Reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is accursed by Scripture, Also <hi>Penn</hi> hath given eight Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons against Gods Prerogative Power in Election and Reprabati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but they are the very absolute Reasonings of a Reprobate, and he hath discovered himself plainly to be one of the seed of the Serpent, a Reprobate that will be damned to eternity, in that he harh opposed, denied and blasphemed in a high nature the Prerogative Power and Will of God, in charging the Creator with being unrighteous, unjust, and more truel then men or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, for electing some men to salvation, and reprobating some men to damnation for his own glory. First, saith he, it renders God most unwise. Secondly, he saith, it greatly disparageth his

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:206971:61"/> that all men by nature are children of wrath, that is, all men are concluded under sin and death, as well the seed of <hi>Adam,</hi> the elect seed, as the seed of the Serpent, the reprobate seed; so that these two seeds have replenished the earth with millions of men and women, more then can be numbred; now these two seeds being sown in the field of this world, and they are both fallen from that excellent estate that God created them in, <hi>viz.</hi> the Serpents seed is f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e seed of <hi>Adam</hi> is fallen from that Paradisical and innocent state he was created in, so that God hath sowed the field of <hi>Adam</hi> fallen, as Wheat in the field of this World; and he hath sowed the seed of the Serpent fallen from his state, as tares in the field of this world, aod they both grow together.</p>
            <p>Now, it would make a man admire, and think it impossible for God to separate these two seeds again, evcn the tares from the wheat, that is, the seed of <hi>Adam</hi> from the seed of the Serpent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and that the seed of <hi>Adam,</hi> the Wheat. the Elect of God, shall be gathered into Gods Barn in the Kingdom of glory; and the tares, the seed of the Serpent, the Reprobates, shall be burnt with unquenchable fire here upon this earth in the Resurrection, when time shall be no more; but saith doth comprehend how God can do this, therefore it is said by <hi>Paul, That all that died in Adam shall be made alive in Christ;</hi> but those that died in the Serpent-Angel shall never be made alive in Christ, why, because all that died in <hi>Adam</hi> are the Elect of God, and shall be saved in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrect<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>on, and all that died in the Serpent are reprobated, and shall be damned in the Resurrection, and this God will do for his own glory, neither could his glory be so exceeding splendent if he did not do thus.</p>
            <p>Again, how is it possible that any man should know himself a R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>probate, and that God hath pre-ordained him unto eternal damnation for to set forth his glory? or how shall any reprobate know his post is pitcht, his state set in Gods Decree, whereby to
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:206971:61"/> encourage him to be avenged of that Decree, and act wickedness the more. This is impossible, for any reprobate to know himself to be a reprobate, and that God hath appointed him to be damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, except he do such things as <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Iudas</hi> did, and then he would avenge himself, nor do no wicked Action to any but to himself, as <hi>Iudas</hi> did; for it is the nature of reason in man, that if he did certainly know that he should be damned, let him do well or ill, then would he be more righteous then before; for the cause why men do such wickednesses and exorbitancies, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they do not know that they are reprobated, and shall be damned to eternity; if they did, they would avoid the doing those things seven times more then they do.</p>
            <p>For the n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t knowing a man is pre-ordained to be damned, is one main cause that makes him Act such wickedness as he doth, because he not knowing he shall be damned, he hopes for mercy, notwithstanding his wicked Actions, which if he knew he were a reprobate, he would Act better things then he doth now he doth not know it; as for example, if you <hi>Penn</hi> the Quaker had known your self to be a reprobate, as well as I do, you would never have blasphemed against the living God in the forme of a man, as you have done: now you do not know your self to be a reprobate, and pre-ordained to be damned.</p>
            <p>For this I say, a man may by faith know his own salvation and election, and the salvation of others, therefore it is that <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> saith, <hi>Make your Calling and El<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>l certainly be damned, though he may fear he shall, yet he hopes he shall not. Again, a man being sure of his own salvation and election, he knoweth perfectly that another man is a reprobate: as for example, I do perfectly know that you <hi>William Penn, George Whitehead, George Fox</hi> and several others of you, <hi>Quakers,</hi> that they are reprob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:206971:62"/> to be damned to eternity, to set forth Gods glory as vessels of wrath: this I do perfectly know, but you know it not, and which way will you deliver your selves from Gods decreeing you in the seed to be damned to eternity, for Gods glory; and my knowing it will be so unto you in the Resurrection; for as I know my self to be of the seed of <hi>Adam,</hi> the seed of faith, and shall be saved; so I do perfectly know that you are the seed of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, the seed of reason, and must be damned, and you no ways can avoid what I have said.</p>
            <p>In the next place, that the Reader may be throughly convinced of Gods Prerogative Power, and submit unto it, as I have done, in his electing and reprobating men and women, some to be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and some to be damned: the Scripture is as full for this very thing, as for any one point whatsoever as may be seen by these Scriptures following.</p>

            <p>Here the Reader may see that God hath elected some men to be saved, and rejected some men to be damned; here it is plain and clear, that the Prophets, Apostles, and Christ himself, did know that some men were elected to salvation, and some men are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destinated for damnation, on purpose to set forth the glory of God, without any relation to righteousness or unrighteousness; but meerly to shew forth the Prerogative Power of the Creator: for what glory could be given to God for his mercy and salvation; if the Creature that is saved did not know that his fellow-creature had no mercy shewed to him, neither doth God shew mercy to his elect, because his sins are less then the sins of the reprobate, for
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:206971:63"/> many of the Elect hath committed greater sins then the reprobate hath, yet because they are the seed of <hi>Adam,</hi> and so elected, God doth shew mercy unto them; and though many of the Serpents seed that hath been righteous all their days between man and man, and hath committed far smaller sins in mans arcount; as for example, the sin against the Holy Ghost is counted by righteous men but a small sin, only for speaking a word against the holy Spirit, calling it the spirit of the devil; God doth judge this sin unpardonable, which legal righteous men count but a small sin, which God counteth the greatest sin of all; and God hath pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed great scarlet sins that hath bin as red as scarlet upon the soul of man, and this sin that is looked upon by legal righteous men as no sin, but thinks they do God good service in blaspheming against the Holy Ghost, in calling the Spirit of truth a devil; which you <hi>Penn</hi> and many of you Quakers have done. This God doth count the greatest sin of all, and hath said that it shall never be forgiven, neither in this life, nor in the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fe to come, but all manner of sins else shall be forgiven unto men.</p>
            <p>So that God will retain his Prerogative Power in election and reprobation for his own glory. for he hath made all things for his own glory, and the wicked for the day of wrath: now if God hath made you <hi>Penn</hi> and others for the day of wrath, as I know he hath, how will you help your self; and though you reply and say, Why doth he yet finde fault, who hath resisted his Will? God doth own that you have not resisted his will, for he made you on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose a vessel of wrath, to set forth his Prer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
